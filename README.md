# Hotel Reservation System
A Hotel Reservation System designed in Java to streamline the process of room reservations in a hotel. 
The system allows users to reserve rooms, view current reservations, update bookings, and delete reservations through a console-based interface. 
The project integrates a MySQL database for storing and managing reservation data, utilizing JDBC for database connectivity.


## Features
- **Reserve a Room:** Users can book a room by providing guest details, room number, and contact information.
- **View Reservations:** Display all existing reservations with details like reservation ID, guest name, room number, and reservation date.
- **Get Room Number:** Retrieve the room number associated with a specific reservation by providing the reservation ID and guest name.
- **Update Reservation:** Modify existing reservation details, such as guest name, room number, and contact information.
- **Delete Reservation:** Remove a reservation from the system by providing the reservation ID.
- **Exit:** Gracefully exit the system.

## Technologies Used
- **Java:** Core programming language for building the system.
- **JDK:**: Java Development Kit (JDK 18 or later) to compile and run the program
- **JDBC:** Java Database Connectivity for interacting with the MySQL database.
- **MySQL:** Database for storing reservation details.
- **IntelliJ IDEA:** Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for coding and debugging.
- **Dotenv:** Java Dependency for managing environment variables like database credentials.
